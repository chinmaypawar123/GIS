1. Go to Layer ‣Add Raster Layer and browse to the 
downloaded us.tmax_nohads_ll_{YYYYMMDD}_float.tif file and click Open.

2. Once the layer is loaded, select the Identify tool and click anywhere on the layer. You will see 
the temperature value in celsius as the value or Band 1 at that location

3. Now unzip the downloaded 2013_Gaz_ua_national.zip file and extract 
the 2013_Gaz_ua_national.txt file on your disk. Go to Layer ‣Add Delimited Text Layer.

4. In the Create a Layer from Delimited Text File dialog, click Browse and 
open 2013_Gaz_ua_national.txt. Choose Tab under Custom delimiters. The point coordinates 
are in Latitude and Longitude, so select INTPTLONG as X field and INTPTLAT as Y field. 
Check the Use spatial index box and click 

6. Open the plugin dialog from Plugins ‣Analyses ‣Point sampling tool.

7. In the Point Sampling Tool dialog, select 2013_Gaz_ua_national as the Layer containing 
sampling points. We must explicitely pick the fields from the input layer that we want in the 
output layer. Choose GEOID and NAME fields from the2013_Gaz_ua_national layer. We can 
sample values from multiple raster band at once, but since our raster has only 1 band, choose 
the us.tmax_nohads_ll_{YYYYMMDD}_float: Band 1. Name the output vector layer 
as max_temparature_at_urban_locations.shp. Click the OK to start the sampling process. 
Click Close once the process finishes

8. You will see a new layer max_temparature_at_urban_locations loaded in QGIS. Use 
the Identify tool to click on any point to see the attributes. You will see the us.tmax_no field -
which contains the raster pixel value at the location of the point

9. First part of our analysis is over. Let’s remove the unnecessary layers. Hold the Shift key and 
select max_temparature_at_urban_locations and 2013_Gaz_ua_national layers. Right-click and 
select Remove to remove them from QGIS TOC.

10. Go to Layer ‣Add Vector Layer. Browse to the downloaded tl_2013_us_county.zip file and 
click Open. Select thetl_2013_us_county.shp as the layer and click OK.

11. The tl_2013_us_county will be added to QGIS. This layer is in EPSG:4269 NAD83 projection. 
This doesn’t match the projection of the raster layer. We will re-project this layer 
to EPSG:4326 WGS84 projection.

12. Right-click the tl_2013_us_county layer and select Save As..

13. In the Save Vector layer as.. dialog, click Browse and name the output file as counties.shp. 
Choose Selected CRS from the CRS dropdown menu. Click Browse and select WGS 84 as the 
CRS. Check the Add saved file to map and click OK

14. A new layer named counties will be add to QGIS.

15. Enable the Zonal Statistics Plugins. This is a core plugin so it is already installed. See Using 
Plugins to know to how enable core plugins.

16. Go to Raster ‣Zonal statistics ‣Zonal statistics.

17. Select us.tmax_nohads_ll_{YYYYMMDD}_float as the Raster layer and counties as 
the Polygon layer containing the zones. Enter ZS_ as the Output column prefix. Click OK.

18. The analysis may take some time depending on the size of the dataset.

19. Once the processing finishes, select the counties layer. Use the Identify tool and click on any 
county polygon. You will see three new attributes added to the 
layer: ZS_count, ZS_mean and ZS_sum. These attributes contain the count of raster pixels, 
mean of raster pixel values and sum of raster pixel values respectively. Since we are interested 
in average temperature, the ZS_meanfield will be the one to use.

20. Let’s style this layer to create a temperature map. Right-click the counties layer and 
select Properties

21. Switch to the Style tab. Choose Graduated style and select ZS_mean as the Column. Choose 
a Color Ramp and Mode of your chose. Click Classify to create the classes. Click OK.

22. You will see the county polygons styled using average maximum temperature extracted from 
the raster grid
