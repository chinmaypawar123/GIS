Procedure

1. Open the “Kenya_epidemiological_data.xls” in Microsoft Excel. Additionally open the
corresponding dictionary “Kenya_epidemiological_dict.xls”, which contains a description of all
variables and information about their coding.

2. You should make note of the number of entries in your database, as you will need to keep track
of any changes e.g. when you remove duplicates at a later stage.

//2A Format of the database
Open Kenya_epidemiological_data.xls in excel.
Go to the View tab, click Freeze Panes and choose Freeze Top Row.

select the entire “child_id‟ column(first column),
Under Home Tab, click on Conditional formatting >Highlight Cell Rules> Select Duplicate values

Now select the first combo box and select Duplicate and select Light red fill with Dark red text in the
next combo box as shown in figure

//2B Removing Duplicates
Select all the columns of existing worksheet
Now go to Data Tab and select Remove Duplicates

//2C Coding of variables
In the current worksheet, select the sex column.
Now type Ctrl+F and use Replace Function and Replace as follows
M-1
F-2
Please keep track of how many values are getting replace.

Step 3 Verifying the plausibility of data
In this step, we perform two basic operations
A. Coding of variables
B. Using a filter to detect outliners

//3A Coding of variables
Select the age column in the existing worksheet.
Now go to Insert tab and select Scatter. You will set chart as shown below

//3B Using a filter to detect outliners
First go to the Home Tab>Sort and Filter>Filter. Click and apply the filter to all the columns of the
worksheet.
Now click on age filter and click on Number Filter> Greater Than option and type the value 20 in
greater than field.

Step 4: Logical Data checks

//4A. Cross Tabulations
Open the existing worksheet. Now go to Insert Tab and select Pivot table function.
Select New Worksheet and click OK
An empty table is inserted in a new sheet and a window will open on the right hand side named PIVOT
TABLE FIELD LIST.

From the PivotTable Field List, drag the “stool” item and drop it into the “Row Label” field as show
above.
Similarly, Click on anysth_inf and draw it into the “Column labels” and “Σ Values” field.
To include the count of observations in the table you might need to change the value field settings to
count.
Click on the combo box Sum of stools and Click on Value Field Settings.
Change the value in Summarize value filed by to Count and click OK. Table is updated with count
values as shown below

//4B Formulas
Open the existing worksheet
Create a new column with the variable called check
Type the following formula in S2 column of worksheet =IF(AND(H2=0, NOT(P2="")),1,0)
Now copy the formula to all other cells (ensure that the formula is copied to all rows in your dataset)
Now use the filter to show only entries with a check value of 1.

Step 5: Verifying the coordinates of mapping data
Create a New Project in QGIS Desktop 3.4.2.
Let’s add the files!
Navigate to Add Vector Layer and add file: Kenya_admin.shp

Similarly, navigate to Add Delimited Text Layer.

Here we have to add file: Kenya_school_location.csv. In the Geometry Definition section, there is a
field called Geometry CRS, in that we have to select WGS84 as coordinate system.
As you can see 2 points are not on the map.

To examine this, we need to save these layers as a Shapefile, to do that select both the layers
Kenya_school_location and Kenya admin, then right click on them and choose Save Features As...
In the menu that comes up, set Format as ESRI Shapefile and put File Name as Kenya_schools.shp
After this is done you can uncheck the Kenya_school_location in the layers section.

Let’s try and get the details of these 2 points that are not on the map, select the Kenya_schools layer,
click on the Identify Features Tool button and then click on the points outside of Kenya to get their
details.
Now we want to add the district information to the map. Therefore, we will join information based on
the geographical localization.
In the menu click on Vector, then Data Management Tools, then select Join attributes by location.

Then select Kenya_schools as Input layer and Kenya_admin as Join layer.
We also need to save the output so in Joined Layer, click “...”button to Browse location.

Save as Kenya_school_district.csv
And then click run.
After it is done...
Navigate to the location of saved file Kenya_school_district.csvand open it, you should now be able to
compare both district and Name for discrepancies.

We need to change the co-ordinate of those 2 points which were not on the map. So, open the file
Kenya_school_location.csv and make the following changes, set:
IBWALI: Longitude 34.6459198
SIWOT: Longitude 35.35437012
Save the file as: Kenya_school_location2.csv.

Step 6: Preparing data for mapping
Open Kenya_epidemiological_data_2.xls, select the entire sheet, go to Insert tab to create new
Pivot Table.
Tick New Worksheet to tell Excel that you want to place the table in a new sheet.

Now click on school_idtodragand drop it in the “Row labels” field at the bottom.
Add district_id to“Σ Values”and click on it, a drop down list will open, click on Value Field
Settings. Choose Average as type of calculation, because all children in the same school will have
same district_id.
Now drag and dropchild_id into the “Σ Values” field, click on Value Field Settings and choose
Count to summarize the results. So, we come to know how many children per school are infected.
Similarly, Drag and dropanysth_inf into the field, click on Value Field Settingsand choose Sum. As,
infected is 1 and not affected is 0, the sum will give us the total number of infected children.

Now copy the table, open a new Excel file and paste the values into the new spreadsheet. Therefore,
click Paste in the Home tab, then choose Paste special and paste only the values.
Remove the last row which has Grand Total and other values.

Save this new data table as Kenya_school_STH_surveys.xlsx
Now we need to know the total count of infected children, that is, the prevalence of STH.
So, w ecreate a new column:sth_previn which we are going to be dividing the number of infected
children by the number of children and multiplying by hundred to obtain a value in percent (%).
In the first cell under the heading type =F2/C2*100 (this assumes that your number of children is in
row C and the number of infected children in row F; you will need to adjust the column label
accordingly); then copy the formula to the other cells in the column.

Additionally, you could calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) of your prevalence.
You will have to create a new column called “CIlow” (lower confidence limit) and “CIup”(upper
confidence limit)
You can calculate the limits by typing the formulas as follows and then copying to the other cells:
For CIlow: =I2 - (1.96*(SQRT((I2*(100-I2)/C2))))
For CIup: =I2 + (1.96*(SQRT((I2*(100-I2)/C2))))
Save this file as Kenya_epidemiological_school.csv
Now that all the datasets are ready, let’s add them.

Open a new QGIS project.
First, add Kenya_school_location2.csv to the project. Click on Add Delimited text layer in the menu,
and browse to select the file.
Similarly, Add Vector Layer and add Kenya_ epidemiological_school.csv
Now we’ll join the data.
Right click on Kenya _school_location2 layer and click on Properties

Go to the Joins section and click on the plus(+) button at the bottom
For “Join layer” chooseKenya_epidemiological_school and for“Join field” and “Target field” choose
school_id. Then click on OK.

Right click on Kenya_school_location2 layer and select Open Attribute Table.
You will see that the epidemiological variables are included.
We are finally done, now we just have to save the files!!
Select all the layers, right-click on them and in Export select Save Features As.

Select Format as ESRI Shapefile and File Name as: Kenya_school_epidata.shp
